## JavaScript: Dark Mode Toggle

![dark-mode-showcase](app-showcase/dark-mode-showcase.gif)

This project is an implementation of Dark Mode made in pure JavaScript.

As a small project, I tried to get things done in a simple and organized way. The implementation includes the LocalStorage to keep the user preferences even if the browser is closed or reloaded.
